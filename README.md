# git-climate-assignment
This repository contains an analysis of monthly average rainfall in Oxford and Melbourne for my Hilary Term 2022 computing assignment.   
The input data, and information on the source of the data, are in 'data'. The data frame created in (1) (see below) is also found here. 
The source code that (1) combines the two locations into a single dataframe and (2) plots the combined data, is in 'src'.  
The output of the analysis, with the session information, are found 'out'.
